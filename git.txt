Got it 👍
Let’s break this into **two workflows**:

---

# 🔹 1. **Your Workflow (Owner of Repo)**

When you add new files/folders and want to push them to GitHub:

```bash
# 1. Check repo status (what’s changed)
git status

# 2. Stage all new/modified files
git add .

# 3. Commit with a message
git commit -m "Added new feature / updated files"

# 4. Pull the latest changes from GitHub before pushing 
# (prevents conflicts if collaborators have updated)
git pull origin main

# 5. Push your changes
git push origin main
```

---

# 🔹 2. **Workflow for Contributors (Team Members)**

## Step A: Fork + Clone

1. Go to your repo on GitHub → click **Fork**.

2. Clone their forked repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Real_Estate_Website.git
   cd Real_Estate_Website
   ```

3. Add **upstream remote** (so they can sync with your original repo):

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Aniket-The-TechWhiz/Real_Estate_Website.git
   ```

---

## Step B: Create a Branch (before making changes)

```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch-name
```

---

## Step C: Make Changes & Push to Fork

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Implemented new feature / fixed bug"

# Push to their fork
git push origin feature-branch-name
```

---

## Step D: Open Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to **their forked repo** on GitHub.
2. Click **Compare & pull request**.
3. Submit PR to **your main repo** (`main` branch).

---

# 🔹 3. **Keeping Fork in Sync (Very Important for Contributors)**

When you update your main repo, team members need to sync their fork:

```bash
# Fetch changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes into local main
git merge upstream/main

# Push updated main to their fork
git push origin main
```

---

✅ **Summary (Chronological Order)**

* **You (Owner):** `git add . → git commit -m "msg" → git pull origin main → git push origin main`
* **Contributors:** Fork → Clone → `git checkout -b new-branch` → `git add . → git commit → git push origin branch` → Open Pull Request.
* **Syncing fork:** `git fetch upstream → git merge upstream/main → git push origin main`.

Do you also want me to give you a **ready-to-paste CONTRIBUTING.md** file (guidelines for your teammates with all these commands) so it’s clear when they join?
